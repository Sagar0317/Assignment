    "Exception in Python:\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event or condition that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an exceptional event occurs, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled by the programmer to deal with unexpected or erroneous situations. Exceptions are Python's way of reporting and handling errors during program execution, making it possible to write robust and fault-tolerant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature of Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program and are typically related to logical errors, external factors, or exceptional conditions that can't be determined at compile time.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the compilation of the code. They are caused by violations of the Python syntax rules, making the code invalid.\n",
    "Timing of Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptional conditions are detected at runtime when the code is executing. They can be anticipated and handled.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors are detected at the time the code is parsed and compiled before the program begins to run. The code with syntax errors will not execute.\n",
    "Handling Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to recover gracefully from errors or take appropriate actions.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled within the program because they prevent the program from running in the first place. You need to fix syntax errors before you can execute the code.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, and FileNotFoundError. These occur due to runtime issues like dividing by zero, attempting to convert an invalid data type, or trying to open a non-existent file.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, incorrect indentation, and typos in variable or function names. These issues prevent the code from being compiled and executed.\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference:"
